DTS Developer Technical Test Submission

Hello and welcome to my Technical Test submission for the Software Developer role (4537)

# Tech Stack
- Frontend: React, Axios
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: MongoDB

I tried to style the layout in keeping with other .gov sites

The form at the top takes a title, optional description and a due date, then posts it to the backend.
Once posted, the task can be deleted, or you can update the status (which is displayed next to the task name).

The main body code for the front end is in src/App.js

# Launch Instructions
- Launch a terminal from inside the /backend folder and use the command: npm run dev
- Launch a terminal from inside the /task-manager-moj folder and use the command: npm start

However, for your convinience I have provided a live version which can be found here:
https://task-manager-moj.vercel.app/
(The live version may take a few minutes to initially load as I am using a free hosting tier for it)

If you have any questions, please contact me using the email address on my CV

I hope to hear from you soon!
